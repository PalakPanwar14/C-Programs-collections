# C Programs Collection

This repository contains a set of C programs that I wrote while learning the basics of the language.  
The programs are simple and cover topics like loops, arrays, strings, functions, recursion, and file handling.

## Contents
- Basic programs  
- Conditional statements  
- Loops  
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Functions  
- Recursion  
- File I/O  

(Will keep adding more programs as I practice.)

## How to compile and run
You can use GCC to compile any program:

gcc filename.c -o output  
./output

Example:
gcc sum.c -o sum  
./sum

## Why I made this repo
Mainly to organize my C codes in one place and keep track of my practice work.

## Note
Some programs have multiple versions because I tried different approaches while learning.
